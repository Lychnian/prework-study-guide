        <h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives content in our webpage structure and provides a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate
           the webpage, and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>We use HTML to build a sturdy frame using HTML elements as our frame's buiding blocks.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An HTML element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Commonly used element types to add content to pages are:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>text elements</li>  
              <li>image elements</li>
              <li>header elements</li>
              <li>list elements</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Common HTML element types used to divide and describe a page are:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Meta-related elements</li>
              <li>content division elements</li>
              <li>semantic elements</li>
            </ol>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Declarations as doctype are not case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The HTML opening tag represent the root or start of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>Inside the HTML is an attribute tag which tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element we have:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>metadata tags</li>       
              <li>title</li>
              <li>styles</li>
              <li>base</li>
              <li>links</li>
              <li>meta</li>
            </ol>
          <li>The HTML elements which provide information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly are:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>!Doctype html</li>
              <li>html</li>
              <li>head</li>
              <li>meta</li>
              <li>title</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Meta and title elements are nested inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The parent element holds the children elements.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>Heading elements in the body element are prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The elements that represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items are <strong>ul, ol, and li.</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>img</strong> element contains information about images that are displayed on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>src</strong> attribute in an img element is most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The <strong>br</strong> element creates a line of empty space or line break.</li>
          <li>The <strong><a> anchor</strong> element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The <strong>href</strong> attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>It is important to use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usualy contains the following:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>author</li>
              <li>copyright</li>
              <li>content</li>
              <li>sitemap</li>
              <li>navigation</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. 
            They help us elegantly organize the content on our page based on topics we may have.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>To access Git, we use the command line.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with <strong>"git"</strong> and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, we use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>

          <li>GitHub Terminology:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Git - a tool that allows developers and others to use version control</li>
              <li>GitHub - one of many web interfaces for using Git</li>
              <li>Organization (org) - a grouping mechanism allowing teams to collaborate across many projects at once.</li>
              <li>Repository (repo) - a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
              <li>Branch - a version of the repo that allows work without affecting other branches. Repos may have many branches for 
                different possible changes being tested or considered, along with a default branch that serves as the source of truth.</li>
              <li>Fork - a new repository that inherits from a parent "upstream" repo. It is used to suggest changes to an "upstream" public
                repo by someone who doesn't have access to edit in the repo's home org.</li>
              <li>Markdown (.md) - a way to write content that converts plain text to formatted text.</li>
              <li>Commit Changes - a saved recford of a change made to a file within the repo.</li>
              <li>Pull Request (PR) - a request for changes made to a branch to be pulled into another branch. Allows multiple users to see, 
                discuss and review work being suggested.</li>
              <li>Merge - after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site.</li>
              <li>Issues - allow users to report issues/bugs and track progress of assigning the fix for the issues.</li>
              <li>Federalist - a platform that securely deploys a website from a GitHub repository in minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes.</li>
              <li>Projects - allows you to use GitHub for project management and tracking a set of issues, either for a specific repo or an entire org.</li>
              <li>Wiki - a section of a repo made for hosting documentation. Documentation may be in the repo's README files instead.</li>
          <li>How to use GitHub step-by-step method to develop users websites:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Step 1</strong> - Team members will open an issue via a project board.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 2</strong> - Team members will create a new branch from the most recent version of the main branch in the repository where
                the entire team works to avoid conflicts.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 3</strong> - Team members will add commits (edits/changes) to their respective branches.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 4</strong> - Team members will open a pull request in which users can assign other team members to review content changes and 
                internally discuss the details of the commits.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 5</strong> - After waiting for the Federalist build to complete, team members can preview the change on a test version of the website 
                and request reviewers to approve or comment on the change. Once the reviewers approve the pull request, the commits merge into the main branch and are 
                published on the live site.</li>
