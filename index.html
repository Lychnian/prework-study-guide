        <h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives content in our webpage structure and provides a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate
           the webpage, and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>We use HTML to build a sturdy frame using HTML elements as our frame's buiding blocks.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An HTML element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Commonly used element types to add content to pages are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>text elements</li>  
              <li>image elements</li>
              <li>header elements</li>
              <li>list elements</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Common HTML element types used to divide and describe a page are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Meta-related elements</li>
              <li>content division elements</li>
              <li>semantic elements</li>
            </ul>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Declarations as doctype are not case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The HTML opening tag represent the root or start of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>Inside the HTML is an attribute tag which tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element we have:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>metadata tags</li>       
              <li>title</li>
              <li>styles</li>
              <li>base</li>
              <li>links</li>
              <li>meta</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The HTML elements which provide information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>!Doctype html</li>
              <li>html</li>
              <li>head</li>
              <li>meta</li>
              <li>title</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Meta and title elements are nested inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The parent element holds the children elements.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>Heading elements in the body element are prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The elements that represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items are <strong>ul, ol, and li.</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>img</strong> element contains information about images that are displayed on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>src</strong> attribute in an img element is most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The <strong>br</strong> element creates a line of empty space or line break.</li>
          <li>The <strong><a> anchor</strong> element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The <strong>href</strong> attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>It is important to use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usualy contains the following:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>author</li>
              <li>copyright</li>
              <li>content</li>
              <li>sitemap</li>
              <li>navigation</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. They help us elegantly organize the content on 
            our page based on topics we may have.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: 
            <ul>
              <li>inline CSS</li>
              <li>internal CSS style sheet</li>
              <li>external CSS style sheet</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.  They are useful
             for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually 
             whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file by embedding an entire stylesheet directly
             in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, 
             which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes
             easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <strong>link</strong> element placed in the HTML's head element.</li>
          <li>a selector (such as div) defines the element or attributes to which the rules (also ruleset), or declarations, will apply. This is the HTML 
            element name at the start of the ruleset.</li>
          <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
          <li>A declaration is a single rule (like color: red;). It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style. It contains two important components: 
            the CSS property we want to apply (such as color) and the value of the property (such as red).</li>
          <li>Properties are ways in which you can style an HTML element, (such as adding color to text in a paragraph).</li>
          <li>Property value are added to the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. 
            (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
          <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
          <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
          <li>Some popular properties are:</li>
            <ul> 
              <li>margin is much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
              <li>padding is how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
              <li>border refers to the solid line that is just outside the padding</li>
              <li>width (of an element)</li>
              <li>background-color behind an element's content and padding</li>
              <li>color an element's content (usually text)</li>
              <li>text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element</li>
              <li>display sets the display mode of an element.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side; the second value affects the left 
            and right side.</li>  
          <li>Auto is a CSS value that has a number of uses. It's the default value for a lot of box-model properties like width, height, margin, and background-size.
             It's also the default value for position properties like top and bottom , left and right and z-index .</li>
          <li>it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, 
            and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>An asterisk (*) is used as a special wild card symbol when we want to apply a rule to <strong>all</strong> the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors or more into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect all <thead></thead> selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which 
            would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>The positioning property, text-align is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>img</strong> selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The <strong>display</strong> property is assigned with the 
            <strong>block</strong> value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class 
            attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, 
            or hex #.</li>
          <li>Adding comments to your CSS will help any future developer work with your CSS file, but will also help you when you come back to the project after a break.  
            To comment in CSS, simply place your plain text inside /*  */ marks.</li>

              <li>Git - a tool that allows developers and others to use version control.</li>
              <li>GitHub - one of many web interfaces for using Git.</li>
              <li>Organization (org) - a grouping mechanism allowing teams to collaborate across many projects at once.</li>
              <li>Repository (repo) - a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
              <li>Branch - a version of the repo that allows work without affecting other branches. Repos may have many branches for 
                different possible changes being tested or considered, along with a default branch that serves as the source of truth.</li>
              <li>Fork - a new repository that inherits from a parent "upstream" repo. It is used to suggest changes to an "upstream" public
                repo by someone who doesn't have access to edit in the repo's home org.</li>
              <li>Markdown (.md) - a way to write content that converts plain text to formatted text.</li>
              <li>Commit Changes - a saved recford of a change made to a file within the repo.</li>
              <li>Pull Request (PR) - a request for changes made to a branch to be pulled into another branch. Allows multiple users to see, 
                discuss and review work being suggested.</li>
              <li>Merge - after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site.</li>
              <li>Issues - allow users to report issues/bugs and track progress of assigning the fix for the issues.</li>
              <li>Federalist - a platform that securely deploys a website from a GitHub repository in minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes.</li>
              <li>Projects - allows you to use GitHub for project management and tracking a set of issues, either for a specific repo or an entire org.</li>
              <li>Wiki - a section of a repo made for hosting documentation. Documentation may be in the repo's README files instead.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>How to use GitHub step-by-step method to develop users websites:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Step 1</strong> - Team members will open an issue via a project board.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 2</strong> - Team members will create a new branch from the most recent version of the main branch in the repository where
                the entire team works to avoid conflicts.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 3</strong> - Team members will add commits (edits/changes) to their respective branches.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 4</strong> - Team members will open a pull request in which users can assign other team members to review content changes and 
                internally discuss the details of the commits.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 5</strong> - After waiting for the Federalist build to complete, team members can preview the change on a test version of the website 
                and request reviewers to approve or comment on the change. Once the reviewers approve the pull request, the commits merge into the main branch and are 
                published on the live site.</li>

          <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, 
            line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)</li>
          <li>The semicolon in JavaScript is used to separate statements, but it can be omitted if the statement is followed by a line break (or there is only one statement
              in a {block}).</li>
            <ul>
              <li>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces 
                 the chances of bugs getting into the code.</li>
              <li>You should not put a semicolon after a closing curly bracket "}". The only exceptions are assignment statements.</li>
              <li>The JavaScript syntax proofing tool JSLint, which is built into the Codecademy code editor, does a pretty good job of finding unnecessary semicolons or missing ones.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</li>
          <li>A JavaScript statement is a piece of code used to instruct the computer on an action to execute.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned 
            (and re-assigned) values of all types.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is
            how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</li>
          <li>A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 – 9). 
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).</li>
          
          <li>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>var - Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
              <li>let - Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
              <li>const - Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>You can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring assignment syntax. For example, const { bar } = foo. This will create a variable named bar and assign 
            to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.</li>
          <li>You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</li>
          <li>Variables should always be declared before they are used. JavaScript used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, 
            which creates an undeclared global variable. This is an error in strict mode and should be avoided altogether.</li>
          <li>Declaration and initialization: In a statement like let x = 42, the let x part is called a declaration, and the = 42 part is called an initializer. The declaration allows the 
            variable to be accessed later in code without throwing a ReferenceError, while the initializer assigns a value to the variable. In var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. 
            If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.</li>
          <li>A variable may belong to one of the following scopes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Global scope:</strong> The default scope for all code running in script mode.</li>
              <li><strong>Module scope:</strong> The scope for code running in module mode.</li>
              <li><strong>Function scope:</strong> The scope created with a function.</li>
              <li><strong>Block scope:</strong> The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block). Variables declared with let or const can belong to block scope.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document.</li>
          <li>When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</li>
          <li>Variable hoisting: var-declared variables are hoisted, meaning you can refer to the variable anywhere in its scope, even if its declaration isn't reached yet. You can see var declarations 
            as being "lifted" to the top of its function or global scope. However, if you access a variable before it's declared, the value is always undefined, because only its declaration is hoisted, 
            but not its initialization.</li>
          <li>Because of hoisting, all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. This best practice increases the clarity of the code.</li>
          <li>Whether let and const are hoisted is a matter of definition debate. Referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration always results in a ReferenceError, because 
            the variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.</li>
          <li>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.</li>
          <li>Constants: You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, 
            or dollar sign ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</li>
          <li>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.</li>
          <li>Data types: The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
              <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.</li>
              <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".</li>
              <li>Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
              <li>Object. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, 
                in which case the property is known as a method.</li>      
            </ul>
          <li>In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier. In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional 
            capability of being callable.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Object properties are 
            equivalent to key-value pairs. Property keys are either strings or symbols. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures.</li>
          <li>There are two types of object properties: The data property and the accessor property.</li>
          <li>JavaScript only has one data type for numbers, both integers and decimals — Number. This means that whatever type of numbers you are dealing with in JavaScript, you handle them in exactly the same way.</li>
          <li>The String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.</li>
          <li>Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, 
            checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */ . Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.</lil>
              <li>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes //.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Condition: An expression that is considered to be either truthy or falsy. Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), 
            to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry", and the outcome of "ate two cookies" might be "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)</li>
          <li>The if...else statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement in the optional else clause will be executed.</li>
          <li>Statement that is executed if condition is truthy. Can be any statement, including further nested if statements. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ /* ... */ }) to group those statements. 
            To execute no statements, use an empty statement.</li>
          <li>Multiple if...else statements can be nested to create an else if clause. Note that there is no elseif (in one word) keyword in JavaScript.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, 
            we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. </li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece
            of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following important statements:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as 
                shown in the following line of code: <strong>var x = 0;</strong></li>
              <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. 
                We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code: <strong>x < shapes.length;</strong></li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every 
                time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code: <strong>x++</strong></li>
              <li>We put the code that we want to be executed for each loop <strong>inside curly brackets {}</strong>. In our case, we want each of the items in the shapes array to be logged in the console. In place of an actual index number, however, we 
                can add the variable x from our for loop. Now, each time the code runs, x will increase by 1 and the next array item will log to the console.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is 
            some obvious relationship between the input and the output.</li>
          <li>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
          <li>The Math namespace object contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
        </ul>
