        <h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives content in our webpage structure and provides a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate
           the webpage, and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>We use HTML to build a sturdy frame using HTML elements as our frame's buiding blocks.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An HTML element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Commonly used element types to add content to pages are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>text elements</li>  
              <li>image elements</li>
              <li>header elements</li>
              <li>list elements</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Common HTML element types used to divide and describe a page are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Meta-related elements</li>
              <li>content division elements</li>
              <li>semantic elements</li>
            </ul>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Declarations as doctype are not case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The HTML opening tag represent the root or start of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>Inside the HTML is an attribute tag which tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element we have:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>metadata tags</li>       
              <li>title</li>
              <li>styles</li>
              <li>base</li>
              <li>links</li>
              <li>meta</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The HTML elements which provide information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>!Doctype html</li>
              <li>html</li>
              <li>head</li>
              <li>meta</li>
              <li>title</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Meta and title elements are nested inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The parent element holds the children elements.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>Heading elements in the body element are prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The elements that represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items are <strong>ul, ol, and li.</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>img</strong> element contains information about images that are displayed on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>src</strong> attribute in an img element is most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The <strong>br</strong> element creates a line of empty space or line break.</li>
          <li>The <strong><a> anchor</strong> element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The <strong>href</strong> attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>It is important to use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usualy contains the following:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>author</li>
              <li>copyright</li>
              <li>content</li>
              <li>sitemap</li>
              <li>navigation</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. They help us elegantly organize the content on 
            our page based on topics we may have.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: 
            <ul>
              <li>inline CSS</li>
              <li>internal CSS style sheet</li>
              <li>external CSS style sheet</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.  They are useful
             for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually 
             whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file by embedding an entire stylesheet directly
             in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, 
             which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes
             easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <strong>link</strong> element placed in the HTML's head element.</li>
          <li>a selector (such as div) defines the element or attributes to which the rules (also ruleset), or declarations, will apply. This is the HTML 
            element name at the start of the ruleset.</li>
          <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
          <li>A declaration is a single rule (like color: red;). It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style. It contains two important components: 
            the CSS property we want to apply (such as color) and the value of the property (such as red).</li>
          <li>Properties are ways in which you can style an HTML element, (such as adding color to text in a paragraph).</li>
          <li>Property value are added to the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. 
            (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
          <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
          <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
          <li>Some popular properties are:</li>
            <ul> 
              <li>margin is much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
              <li>padding is how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
              <li>border refers to the solid line that is just outside the padding</li>
              <li>width (of an element)</li>
              <li>background-color behind an element's content and padding</li>
              <li>color an element's content (usually text)</li>
              <li>text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element</li>
              <li>display sets the display mode of an element.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side; the second value affects the left 
            and right side.</li>  
          <li>Auto is a CSS value that has a number of uses. It's the default value for a lot of box-model properties like width, height, margin, and background-size.
             It's also the default value for position properties like top and bottom , left and right and z-index .</li>
          <li>it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, 
            and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>An asterisk (*) is used as a special wild card symbol when we want to apply a rule to <strong>all</strong> the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors or more into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect all <thead></thead> selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which 
            would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>The positioning property, text-align is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>img</strong> selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The <strong>display</strong> property is assigned with the 
            <strong>block</strong> value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class 
            attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, 
            or hex #.</li>
          <li>Adding comments to your CSS will help any future developer work with your CSS file, but will also help you when you come back to the project after a break.  
            To comment in CSS, simply place your plain text inside /*  */ marks.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Git - a tool that allows developers and others to use version control.</li>
              <li>GitHub - one of many web interfaces for using Git.</li>
              <li>Organization (org) - a grouping mechanism allowing teams to collaborate across many projects at once.</li>
              <li>Repository (repo) - a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
              <li>Branch - a version of the repo that allows work without affecting other branches. Repos may have many branches for 
                different possible changes being tested or considered, along with a default branch that serves as the source of truth.</li>
              <li>Fork - a new repository that inherits from a parent "upstream" repo. It is used to suggest changes to an "upstream" public
                repo by someone who doesn't have access to edit in the repo's home org.</li>
              <li>Markdown (.md) - a way to write content that converts plain text to formatted text.</li>
              <li>Commit Changes - a saved recford of a change made to a file within the repo.</li>
              <li>Pull Request (PR) - a request for changes made to a branch to be pulled into another branch. Allows multiple users to see, 
                discuss and review work being suggested.</li>
              <li>Merge - after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site.</li>
              <li>Issues - allow users to report issues/bugs and track progress of assigning the fix for the issues.</li>
              <li>Federalist - a platform that securely deploys a website from a GitHub repository in minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes.</li>
              <li>Projects - allows you to use GitHub for project management and tracking a set of issues, either for a specific repo or an entire org.</li>
              <li>Wiki - a section of a repo made for hosting documentation. Documentation may be in the repo's README files instead.</li>
          <li>How to use GitHub step-by-step method to develop users websites:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Step 1</strong> - Team members will open an issue via a project board.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 2</strong> - Team members will create a new branch from the most recent version of the main branch in the repository where
                the entire team works to avoid conflicts.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 3</strong> - Team members will add commits (edits/changes) to their respective branches.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 4</strong> - Team members will open a pull request in which users can assign other team members to review content changes and 
                internally discuss the details of the commits.</li>
              <li><strong>Step 5</strong> - After waiting for the Federalist build to complete, team members can preview the change on a test version of the website 
                and request reviewers to approve or comment on the change. Once the reviewers approve the pull request, the commits merge into the main branch and are 
                published on the live site.</li>
